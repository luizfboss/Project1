            <h1 id="first">Android's mascot story</h1>

            <p>
                You might know that the operational system<strong><a href="">Android</a></strong>, owned by <strong><a href="">Google</a></strong>is one of the most used operational systems for mobile devices in the world. However, did you know that the mascot has a really curious name and story? Follow this article to learn about this little green robot.
            </p>
        
            <h2>The first version</h2>

            <p>The first try of creation was in 2007, by <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/dan-morrill-shows-us-the-android-mascot-that-almost-was-20130103/" target="_blank">Dan Morrill &#x1F517</a>. He claims that he launched<strong><a href="https://inkscape.org/pt-br/" target="blank_">Inkscape &#x1F517</a></strong>(a free software for image vectorization) and created his own robot version. His goal was to customize the system for his workmates, and there was no company request to create a new mascot.</p><br>

            <p>The first creepy version was called <strong>Dandroids</strong>.</p>
        
        <h2 id="mascot">A new mascot shows up</h2>
        
            <p>The idea of having a mascot had been maturing and the mission was given to a professional of this field. The russian illustrator <a href="https://www.irinablok.com/" target="_blank">Irina Blok &#x1F517</a>, a Google, was responsible for the creation of a more friendly version of this robot.</p>

            </picture>
            
            <p>Irina's main idea was to represent everything in a more minimalist way. The drawing also had to have a quick recognition. The<strong>Bugdroid</strong> was created.</p>
            
            <img id="stickman" class="pequena" src="pacote-projeto-d010/imagens/bugdroid.png" alt="Bugdroid">
            <p>The main inspiration for the new<strong>Bugdroid</strong>sketches came from those stickmans from restroom doors, in order to identify the genders for each restroom. It is said that the artist was creating on your desk at<strong>Google</strong>and looked to the restrooms and the recognition was immediate: simple and clean.

                <p>Other curious subjects related to the Android is that every version always was renamed in honor to a candy, in alphabetical order from 1.5 version to 9.0 version.</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>1.5 - Cupcake</li>
                    <li>1.6 -  Donut</li>
                    <li>3.0 -  Eclair</li>
                    <li>2.2 -  Froyo</li>
                    <li>2.3 -  Gingerbread</li>
                    <li>3.0 -  Honeycomb</li>
                    <li>4.0 -  Ice Cream Sandwich</li>

                    <li>9.0 -  Piev</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Unfortunately,<strong>Android Q</strong>didn't exist, because Google decided to end this funny practice and started to use numbers, which originated Android 10.</p>
